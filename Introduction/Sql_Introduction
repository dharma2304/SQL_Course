What is a database?

A database is nothing but the collection/storage of data in the form of tables.

What is table?

A table is the way of storing the data in rows and columns.
There are majorly 2 types of databases.

Relational Databases
Non-Relational Databases

Relational Databases: It is the type of database which stores the data in the form of tables( rows and columns ). And there will be relationship between the tables. So they are called
Relational databases.

                                        Examples: MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgres SQL, Maria DB, SQLLite

Non Relational Databases: It is the type of database which dont store the data in the form of tables. It stores in different formats like Key-Value pair , Document etc. And there will be  
 no relationship between the tables.

                                             Examples: Hbase, MongoDB, Cassandra

The Programming language used to work with relational databases is SQL

SQL: Structured Query Language

Basically database is a software and SQL is language to interact with software

Note: goorm ide is online ide to practice sql.

GETTING STARTED WITH SQL:

Note: All the keywords in SQL are in UPPER CASE and all the user defined variables are LOWER CASE

Commands:

1.  SHOW DATABASES ; -----> To get to know what are the databases present .

2.  CREATE DATABASE <database_name>; —-> To create a database

3.  DROP DATABASE <database_name>; —-> To delete the database

4.  USE <database_name>; ——> To use or enter into a particular database

5.  SELECT database(); —-> To know in which database we are present.

6.  CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
    <column_name> <data_type>,
    <column_name> <data_type>,
    <column_name> <data_type>

    );

    The above syntax creates a table in the database which are present in. We
    Should be present inside an database.Otherwise we cannot create a table.

                    OR
          create table with constraints like NOT NULL --> we are imposing the constraints to columns

          CREATE TABLE employee(
            first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
            last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
            age INT NOT NULL,
            salary INT NOT NULL,
            location VARCHAR(30)
          );

          In the above case we are imposing the constraint NOT NULL which means the column values should not be null.

                     OR
        In this version we are using default values for columns. For example if we still want to get the value inserted when the user didnt gave the value, then we can use default values while creating the table.

        CREATE TABLE employee(
            first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
            last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
            age INT NOT NULL,
            salary INT NOT NULL,
            location VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'bangalore'
          );

7.  SHOW TABLES; —-> To know what are the tables present in the database.

8.  DESC <table_name> ——> This will return the structure of the table like list  
     Of columns, data_types of columns etc.

9.  DROP TABLE <table_name> —-> To delete the table from the database.
